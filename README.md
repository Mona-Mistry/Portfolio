# Portfolio
# Fuel Consumption Analysis
A data analysis project focused on exploring and understanding vehicle fuel consumption data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using Python. The project uses data visualization and regression modeling to evaluate factors affecting fuel efficiency.
# Getting Started: 
# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before beginning the project:
-Python 3.x
-The Jupyter Lab and Notebook
-And the following Python libraries to make sure the code runs smoothly- 
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
You can install the required libraries using: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
# Installing
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fuel-consumption-analysis.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd fuel-consumption-analysis
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook FuelConsumption2.ipynb
#  Running the Tests
Breakdown of Tests:
Included in this project are:

Analyzing data visually with plots and statistical summaries is known as data exploration.

Model evaluation: CO2 emissions are predicted using a linear regression model.

Metrics like as MAE, MSE, and R2 score are used to assess the correctness of the model.
To test:

Run all cells in sequence to observe data processing, training, and evaluation.

# Deployment
The Jupyter Notebook is intended for local execution of this project. At this time, there is no support for production deployment.
